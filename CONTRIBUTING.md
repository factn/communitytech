# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you
agree to abide by the [code of conduct].

## Forking workflow 

Anyone can get started and start coding without having to ask for permission because we follow the **forking workflow** 

The super short version is:
- [Fork] this repo
- Clone your repo to your local machine
```
git clone git@github.com:your-username/communitytech.git
```
- Set up your dev environment as described on the [README](https://github.com/factn/communitytech/blob/master/README.md)
- Make your change and test it works
- Commit your changes
- Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

At this point you're waiting on us to comment and approve your Pull Request (aka 'PR'). Things are moving very fast and we are working to get to all the PRs as fast as possible but we should get back to you in a couple of days at most (usually within a few hours at the moment).

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write clean code 
* Build a feature we need
* Write a [good commit message][commit]
* Come [join our slack] and talk to us about it there - in the #communitytech channel.

This process is explained in more detail [by Github here][fork] and [by Atlassian here].

## What are the list of tasks that need doing?

For now, please [join our slack] to get a sense of where things are at, but we are working on a roadmap and a list of user stories as well as bunch of designs. All these things are happening at the same time, so stay tuned for those links. We're working hard to capture needs directly from mutual aid groups on the ground. 

## Who approves PRs?

At the moment all PRs need to be approved by one of the people with commit/write access to the core repository.

You can see [who is currently in that group](https://github.com/orgs/factn/teams/communitytech_admins)

But you don't need to be a core committer in order to commit to our project. Check out the [list of contributors](https://github.com/factn/communitytech/graphs/contributors)


## What does success look like? 

- Be helpful, on the ground, for real world organisers
- Be easy for new developers to commit code quickly
- Be easy to use
- Be robust and scalable

**No matter your role, your help is very much appreciated!**
